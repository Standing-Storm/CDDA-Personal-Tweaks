Just some personal adjustments to Arcana, mostly nerfs to things that are too powerful for my preferred playstyle.

The biggest change is that learning Pattern spells is no longer automatic--requires an arcana skill roll against a difficulty. This provides a choice between making Pattern Scrolls (could teach you the spell permanently, but it's hard to learn them) and Magic Seals (single use, but always works)

I also changed all the spell names to make them a bit more eldritch.  Just personal preference.
